## Cloud-init

Kip supports provisioning new Cells through a subset of functionality provided by the popular cloud-init system.  Users can specify a cloud-init file in provider.yaml and the cloud-init file will be applied when a Cell is booted by Kip. The cloud-init file can be used to provision users and ssh keys on a kip cell or setup additional packages on the cell.

Kip's cloud-init system provides the following initialization functions:

* Initialize users and set SSH authorized keys
* Set SSH authorized keys for the root user
* Set the hostname
* Write arbitrary files (allowed encodings: plain text, base64, gzip and gzip+base64)
* Run commands in a single invocation (using /bin/sh) with the runcmd module

### Cloud-init Example

In provider.yaml specify the location for the cloud-init file in the kip pod:
```yaml
cells:
  cloudInitFile: /etc/kip/cloudinit.yaml
```

cloudinit.yaml contents:

```yaml
users:
  - name: "dbowie"
    passwd: "$6$qhNlkpFW$p.YhGhk1zFd0bQ1Quk/3O42qEtp7vjZ5DB8C/l/VUB..."
    groups:
      - "wheel"
    ssh_authorized_keys:
      - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDPU7h8CaYA1VH/CwY3Ah..."

# without a user, ssh_authorized_keys will be added to the root user
ssh_authorized_keys:
  - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC0g+ZTxC7weoIJLUafOgrm+h..."

write_files:
  - content: |
        [Unit]
        Description=Socket for the API

        [Socket]
        ListenStream=2375
        Service=docker.service

        [Install]
        WantedBy=sockets.target
    owner: root:root
    path: /root/config
    permissions: "0644"
  - encoding: gzip
    content: !!binary |
        H4sIAIDb/U8C/1NW1E/KzNMvzuBKTc7IV8hIzcnJVyjPL8pJ4QIA6N+MVxsAAAA=
    path: /usr/bin/hello
    permissions: "0755"

hostname: foo.bar.com

# runcmd commands must be supplied as an array of strings
# be sure to properly quote your strings so they can be parsed as yaml
runcmd:
  - 'echo "dbowie   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/dbowie'
  - apk update
  - apk add curl
```

The cloudinit.yaml file should be created as a ConfigMap and mounted into the pod as a volume.  The file must be mounted into the pod in the same location specified in provider.yaml

### Limitations

The cloud-init file is served to Cells through the EC2 User Data.  User Data is limited to a size of 16KB.  Internally, Kip uses approximately 4KB of the User Data leaving 12K of data for a user's cloud-init file.  If the cloud-init file is too large, Kip will not be able to start Cells.  Currently we do not compress the user data.
